<p style="color:Tomato;">PHISHING:<br></p>
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.<br></p>
 six of the most common types of phishing attacks:<br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">1. DECEPTIVE PHISHING:<br></p>
Deceptive phishing is by far the most common type of phishing scam. In this type of ploy, fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company in an attempt to steal people's personal data or login credentials. Those emails frequently use threats and a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want.<br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">2. SPEAR PHISHING:<br></p>
In this type of ploy, fraudsters customize their attack emails with the target's name, position, company, work phone number and other information in an attempt to trick the recipient into believing that they have a connection with the sender. <br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">3. CEO FRAUD:<br></p>
Spear phishers can target anyone in an organization, even executives. That's the logic behind a "whaling" attack. In these scams, fraudsters try to harpoon an exec and steal their login details.<br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">4. VISHING:<br></p>
This type of phishing attack dispenses with sending out an email and instead goes for placing a phone call. As noted by Comparitech, an attacker can perpetrate this type of attack by setting up a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) server to mimic various entities in order to steal sensitive data and/or funds.<br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">5. SMISHING:<br></p>
This method leverages malicious text messages to trick users into clicking on a malicious link or handing over personal information.<br>
<p style="color:Tomato;">6. PHARMING:<br></p>
This method of phishing leverages cache poisoning against the domain name system (DNS), a naming system that the Internet uses to convert alphabetical website names, such as "www.microsoft.com", to numerical IP addresses so that it can locate and thereby direct visitors to computer services and devices.<br>
